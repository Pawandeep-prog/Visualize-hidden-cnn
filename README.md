See what it can do : https://youtu.be/DEvqkn3dP70

Did you ever wanted to see what is going on inside neural network I mean the output of hidden layers well this video is for you. Using this webapp I built using flask you can easily select your own model and give input image and just visualize each hidden layer which outputs 4-D data which is image data.
This video is the visualisation of what the below code is all about or just taking you through what you can do from below code.
This code just lays out all your hidden layers and then you can click any layer you want to see output of.
It's that simple. So just enjoy the code and get better understanding of everything
